# Community

WikiTraveler is built for a **federated mesh** — independent operators, shared protocol, community-owned data. This guide explains how people participate and how the project scales with a larger community.

---

## Roles in the ecosystem

| Role | What you do | Primary docs |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Traveler** | Browse accessibility facts via **hub Access** (canonical `access.wikitraveler.org`) or agency widgets | Prefer the public hub; regional Access is optional branding |
| **Auditor** | Submit on-site verified audits | [AUDITOR-ONBOARDING.md](./AUDITOR-ONBOARDING.md) · [apps/README.md](../apps/README.md) Flow 2 |
| **Node operator** | Run a sovereign regional node (API + data); allow trusted hub origins | [OPERATORS.md](./OPERATORS.md) |
| **Hub operator** | Run canonical / backup / branded Access; uptime for travelers | [OPERATORS.md](./OPERATORS.md#audiences) · [VERCEL.md](./VERCEL.md) |
| **Client maintainer** | Customize Access, Lens, SDK integrations | [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) · [LENS.md](./LENS.md) |
| **Core contributor** | Protocol, gossip, merge logic, shared packages | [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| **Maintainer** | Releases, migrations, federation compatibility | [RELEASES.md](./RELEASES.md) |

No central vendor is required. Operators choose when to deploy; contributors improve the open toolkit everyone shares. Nodes hold truth; Access is a client.

## How the mesh grows

1. **Bootstrap peers** — New nodes list known peers in `BOOTSTRAP_PEERS` (seed from [PUBLIC-PEERS.md](./PUBLIC-PEERS.md) when available); startup discovery expands the peer table.
2. **Gossip exchange** — Every sync includes peer lists (with optional protocol/version hints); the network discovers itself organically.
3. **Regional resolution** — Clients call `/api/peers/resolve` so travelers reach the right regional node.
4. **Federated auth** — Register once on a home node; with RS256, browse/audit peers without re-registering ([FEDERATED-AUTH.md](./FEDERATED-AUTH.md)).
5. **Shared releases** — Tagged repo releases give operators a common baseline without forced remote updates.

Operators are **not** required to run the latest version immediately. The project supports **N and N-1** node versions in the mesh. Breaking changes get a documented sunset window — see [RELEASES.md](./RELEASES.md) · [COMPATIBILITY.md](./COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Contributing code

1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch naming, PR checks, labels, and review expectations.
2. Set up locally via [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) and [LOCAL.md](./LOCAL.md).
3. For federation changes, run the gossip lab: [GOSSIP-DEV.md](./GOSSIP-DEV.md) (`pnpm gossip:discovery`).
4. For UI changes, run accessibility checks: [ACCESSIBILITY.md](./ACCESSIBILITY.md).
5. Federation-impacting design: open an **RFC** ([docs/rfcs/](./rfcs/README.md)).

**Good first contributions:** docs fixes, i18n strings (`packages/i18n`), test coverage, operator runbook improvements, **global region presets** (cities/countries outside the current catalog — see [LOCAL.md](./LOCAL.md#region-presets-global-catalog)). Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

**Needs design discussion first:** gossip protocol shape changes, Prisma breaking migrations, auth model changes (use the RFC template).

## Contributing as an auditor

Public Access signup may be **off** during controlled tests. That is intentional — trust is not ambient.

1. Read [AUDITOR-ONBOARDING.md](./AUDITOR-ONBOARDING.md).
2. Reach out via GitHub (issue/discussion) with region + independence context.
3. A maintainer creates your home-node account, sets `AUDITOR`, and walks you through Access + a first triage audit.
4. Prefer on-site facts and photos; never promote AI guesses to verified truth.

Hotel-inspection firms: same pipeline — bring accessibility into visits you already make; keep verification independent of the property’s sales desk.

## Contributing as an operator

You do not need to merge code to participate:

- Run a public node and opt into the [public peers directory](./PUBLIC-PEERS.md).
- Allow the **canonical hub** (and backup) origins on your node so travelers stay on one Access worldwide ([RFC-0002](./rfcs/0002-global-hub-access.md)).
- Optionally publish a branded Access URL for your region — not required for mesh participation.
- Share OSM ingest experience and propose bbox presets for underserved continents/cities.
- Report federation issues with `pnpm gossip:check` / `pnpm gossip:discovery` output and peer `/api/nodeinfo` responses.

Use the **Operator help** issue template when asking for deployment support.

---

## Communication norms

- **Be specific** — Include node version (`/api/health`), deployment type (Docker/Vercel), and migration state.
- **Respect sovereignty** — Operators control their infrastructure; avoid prescriptive “everyone must upgrade today” unless security-critical.
- **Document decisions** — Federation and API changes belong in `docs/` and [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).
- **Follow the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** in all project spaces.

---

## Governance (lightweight)

Today the project uses **maintainer-led merge** on `main`:

- `main` is always intended to be deployable.
- Releases are tagged `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with notes in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md); aim for a [monthly minor](./RELEASES.md#release-cadence) when there is ship-facing work.
- Breaking gossip or database changes require an [RFC](./rfcs/README.md) and a [RELEASES.md](./RELEASES.md) compatibility note before merge.

As the community grows, maintainers may add:

- Operator office hours or Matrix/Discord (linked from README when established)
- More structured contribution ladders and translator checklists

None of these replace per-operator deployment control. Public priorities live in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).
